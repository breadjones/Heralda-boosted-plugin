# Heralda, the helpful Discord Herald Bot

[Heralda](https://github.com/EbekFrostblade/Heralda-chat-bot) is a chat bot that announces the arrival of new users to voice channels in Discord. She uses voicerss.org to retrieve text-to-speech voice clips, which she then plays in the voice channel.

She can also be a little mean, when given the right plugins...

## This Component

This is a fun component that stems from an inside joke in our group. Some chat programs give upvotes/downvotes, some give tacos or slices or other various things. Us? We like to boost eachother.

When someone is boosted, they either did something so bad that it's noteworth, or they said something so silly it's nearly legendary. Not all things are equally boosted, which is why it is scored in tiers.

## Configuration

You can configure the plugin by changings your `_config.json` file in your Heralda root directory:

```javascript
{
  
}

```
